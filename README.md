## Description

The Turtle Race Game is a fun project that simulates a race between multiple turtles. Each turtle is assigned a color and starts from the same position. The user can place a bet on which turtle will win, and the race begins once a bet is placed. Turtles move forward by a random distance in each step, and the first turtle to cross the finish line wins the race.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-race-game.git
    cd turtle-race-game
    ```

2. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. Install the necessary modules if they are not already installed. This project uses the `turtle` and `random` modules, which are included with Python by default.

## Usage

1. Run the `turtle_race.py` script:

    ```sh
    python turtle_race.py
    ```

2. When prompted, enter the color of the turtle you think will win the race.

3. Watch the turtles race across the screen! The program will notify you if you have won or lost based on your bet.
